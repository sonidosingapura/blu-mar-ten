> "It started as a bit of fun to kill time in between proper music work and suddenly became quite large, so it seemed a shame not to share it." — Blu Mar Ten

> "If you're not already familiar with how drum & bass came into being, we encourage you to go back in time and explore the history. There's some amazing music waiting for you there." — Blu Mar Ten
